## About

I am a backend developer with a primary focus on building structured, efficient, and maintainable systems.
I enjoy working close to the core of applications—data flow, API design, and system behavior—while keeping implementations clean and purposeful.

I believe continuous learning is essential, especially in backend engineering where systems evolve as fast as the problems they solve.
